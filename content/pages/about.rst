When i work with code i always put humans first - let it be the style of the code itself, the overall architecture or the usability. Every Software and every code should be written for humans first and machines second.  

Hi I am Marvin and I'm Data engineer / Software architect. At work i love to solve problems and help other people using  my code and the knowledge i acquired so far. When i code or supervise other I make sure that the human always comes first and a machine only second. This counts for the style, the architecture or the usability. Moreover, I am always on the lookout to find new and interesting frameworks and projects which might help me to solve the next problems in an even better way. 

After work i enjoy to cook while listening to either some pod-casts or some metal music and on weekends I love to share a wine or beer with some friends until the chaos starts again on Monday.
